### What I'll Have to Learn
Include what you will need to learn here
-Javascript
-Google Maps API or other mapping API. There are variety of ways expand beyond displaying just points. For example there is a “Directions API” or “Distance Matrix API”. In order to have the user add a point I have to determine what I can do. They easiest is to add a lat and long which is not useful. I might have to use a geodcoding API to enable them to input an address.
